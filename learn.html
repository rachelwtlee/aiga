                    Our data comes from the <a href="https://designcensus.org/" target="_blank">2019 AIGA Design Census &#8599</a>, which surveys design professionals across the country about their salary, job satisfaction, future outlook, etc. Looking at the dataset, we were drawn to the question “What critical issues face design?” where we found a hidden gem: while respondents could choose from multiple-choice answers, <span id="italic">they could also write-in their own answers!</span>
                </h1>
                
                <h1>
                    It was in the 2700+ written responses we found the “core” of the respondents’ feelings: honesty, frustration, skepticism, and hope. As direct quotes, these words were personal in a way that the more discrete data was not. We wanted to use this corpus to tell a story, to see data points as people, and not as numbers.

                    This project exists in two forms: an exploratory website, and a printed, interactive book. We designed both of these artifacts as tools for data exploration, but specifically, exploration that <span id="italic">begins with language.</span>

                <h1>
                    We used python and NLTK to parse the corpus, collecting the most frequent 150 words (excluding function words like “I,” “the,” “only,” etc.), bi-grams and tri-grams. Looking at the lists, we picked out words and phrases that described themes or ideas. From there, we grouped the words into six broader categories: power, representation, education, quality, change, and community.
                </h1>
                <h1>
                    We used these dictionaries to parse through the quotes again in order to sort which responses fell in which category.

                    This site is a prototype of a bigger collection, because we couldn’t integrate all 2700+ quotes. We selected ~25 quotes per category to analyze further, and picked phrases that described the main point or theme of each response. If quotes intersected with other categories, we made sure to highlight those phrases as well. (And we made a super sexy color-coded <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15In8OSasHoC0KUkLolkmvFJeyXUj2fERDnqrUyhqZAM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet &#8599</a> ) To find spot words (eg. 18 mentions of “age-ism”), we ran word frequency throughwith the entire corpus.
